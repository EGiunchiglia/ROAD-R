# ROAD-R 

Dataset and code for the paper "[ROAD-R: The Autonomous Driving Dataset with Logical Requirements](https://learn-to-race.org/workshop-ai4ad-ijcai2022/assets/papers/paper_10.pdf)".


## Annotated requirements

The annotated requirements can be found in the [requirements folder](requirements) in two formats:

1. [requirements_dimacs.txt](requirements/requirements_dimacs.txt) contains the requirements written in dimacs format. Here, each label is represented as a number.

2. [requirements_readable.txt](requirements/requirements_readable.txt) contains the reqiurements written in a human understable format. 

The natural language explanation of each requirement can be found in the appendix of the paper.

## ROAD 

The ROAD dataset is available at: https://github.com/gurkirt/road-dataset.
